Hugely popular, he presided over enormous growth, but corruption raged under his tenure, as did electoral manipulation and often violent suppression of dissent.  This film tells Joh’s story through rare archival footage and revelatory interviews, exploring a life shaped by a hard yakka, god-fearing upbringing on his family’s farm. Trump’s spectre is evoked in Joh’s famously mangled and meandering way of speaking – brilliantly dramatised by Richard Roxburgh – alongside his unyielding execution of power and the desperate denial of his final days in office.</p>

                <p class="movie-synopsis">From their iconic house and studio in London’s Brick Lane, Gilbert & George have been at the forefront of British art for over half a century. Their unmistakable art is stark, urban, poetic, profoundly romantic, brutally realistic, and wholly visionary. It has captivated mainstream audiences around the globe. By unpacking their long and literal walk through life – repeatedly likened to a Pilgrimage – substantially with their voices, and few other commentators, the film offers a rare, deep, and captivating insight into their personal philosophy.</p>
